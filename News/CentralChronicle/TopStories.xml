				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://www.centralchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Swami_Sonia.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-78309" src="http://www.centralchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Swami_Sonia-400x245.jpg" alt="Swami_Sonia" width="400" height="245" /></a></p>
<p>Agencies, Chennai</p>
<p>Senior BJP leader and Union Telecommunications and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today slammed both the Congress and DMK as corrupt parties and said AICC President Sonia Gandhi and its Vice President Rahul Gandhi should break their silence on the Augusta-Westland VVIP chopper deal scam.</p>
<p>Talking to reporters after launching the BJP&#8217;s election propaganda<br />
song CD here for the May 16 Assembly polls in Tamil Nadu,, the minister said &#8221;from 2G scam, to the multi-crore coal blocks allocation scam and now the Augusta-Westland chopper deal scam involving Congress.</p>
<p>Questioning the silence being maintained by Ms Sonia Gandhi and AICC Mr Rahul Gandhi on the issue, Mr Prasad said, &#8220;Ms Sonia must explain to the nation on this&#8221;.</p>
<p>Referring to the conviction of Italian officials linked to the VVIP chopper scam, the Union Minister also asked the then Defence<br />
Minister A K Antony to name the party leaders, allegedly involved in<br />
the scandal.</p>
<p>Stating that Mr Antony in March 2013, had told Parliament<br />
that corruption had taken place in the purchase of VVIP choppers<br />
and that bribe was given, Mr Prasad sought to know from the former Defence Minister, whether any Congress leader was involved in it or not.</p>
<p>The minister said whenever he comes to Tamil Nadu, he always could see a coalition between the DMK and the Congress.</p>
<p>Stating that both the corrupt parties have come together to face<br />
the ensuing assembly elections, Mr Prasad said, the Sanchar Bhavan, where the multi-crore 2G scam took place during the previous UPA regime, would now present an entirely different picture.</p>
<p>&#8221;In the BJP-led NDA government headed by Prime Minister<br />
Narendra Modi, all decisions are taken fairly, transparently and<br />
honestly&#8217;, the minister pointed out.</p>
<p>&#8221;There has been no incident of corruption during the two year<br />
Modi rule&#8221;, Mr Prasad reasoned.</p>
<p>&#8221;I invite the media friends to come for a tea with me&#8230;you will<br />
find transparency. There is no middlemen&#8221;, he assured.</p>
<p>Asked about the AIADMK, Mr Prasad said, it was also corrupt.<br />
&#8221;But the larger concern for BJP is development of Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>The development level in the State is coming down. Investment and<br />
growth are also coming down&#8221;, he charged.</p>
<p>Stating that &#8216;Lotus&#8217; (the symbol of BJP) has become a beacon of<br />
hope to the people of the State, Mr Prasad said &#8221;BJP is the voice<br />
of hope, voice of aspiration and voice of nationalism&#8221;.</p>
<p>The minister appealed to the people of the state to extend their whole-hearted support to the BJP in the coming assembly elections, so that Mr Modi&#8217;s development process could be ensured in Tamil Nadu.</p>
<p>Referring to Union Minister Nirmala Seetharaman&#8217;s remarks that<br />
Tamil Nadu was at the forefront in development and he (Mr Prasad) was saying that development was coming down, Mr Prasad hastened to add that Tamil Nadu was backward in investment and industrial development.</p>

<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>Prime Minister&#8217;s Office has sought report from the Uttarakhand government over raging forest fires even as the Opposition Congress today slammed the BJP Government at the Centre for not taking due steps for controlling flames that left six people dead and destroyed 1,600 hectare forests.</p>
<p>The PMO sought information on fires in forests from the state and assured all possible relief, official sources said.</p>
<p>As many as three teams of National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) with a strength of 135 personnel, had also been sent to the state for helping in putting out flames, they said.</p>
<p>Raging fires broke out in more than 1,500 villages, you have dismissed state government (led by Congress), hence, putting out flames is now your(Centre) responsibility, the opposition party wrote at its twitter handle this afternoon.</p>
<p>At least six people have so far died and around 1,600 hectare of forests had been destroyed, the party added in the tweet.</p>

<p>New Delhi : Demanding a 100 percent hike in salaries and allowances for themselves, Members of Parliament have said they deserve this raise for their ‘good conduct’.</p>
<p>The bill to raise remmuneration of MPs is expected to be passed in the next session of Parliament. As per a report in agencies, a parliamentary committee has suggested that the salary of MPs be raised from Rs. 50,000 to a lakh a month and a constituency allowance from Rs. 45000 to 90000.</p>
<p>If the committee’s proposal are accepted, the total compensation package for an MP will go up from Rs. 1,40,000 to 2,80,000. Meanwhile, BJP MP Yogi Adityanath has further recommended 75 percent rise in pensions.</p>
<p>“A parliamentary committee which decides on the salary and allowance of MPs had given a report which has been suppressed due to media pressure. MPs deserve the hike for their “good conduct”,” report quotes Samajwadi Party leader Naresh Agarwal who had brought up the salary hike in the Rajya Sabha on Monday.</p>

<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>Facing CBI probe in multi-crore bribery charges in the VVIP chopper deal, former Chief of Air Staff Air Chief Marshal SP Tyagi has expressed surprise over, what he felt, a sudden move of the central investigative agency, which is set cross examine him tomorrow in connection with the case.</p>
<p>In his facebook update which he posted late last night, the former Air Chief also took potshots at media, specially on TV news channels. Tyagi is in the eye of storm, as the main Opposition Congress has put the government in dock, asking the Centre what links he had with National Security Advisor Ajit Doval and Principle Secretary to Prime Minister Nripendra Mishra as his name figured at the website of the Vivekananda International Foundation, a charge rejected by the government.</p>
<p>Tyagi did not react to the slugfest between the Congress and the ruling BJP. He trained his guns on TV channels, CBI and ED instead. “Watching news. Understand I got a lot of money for doing nothing. I have been wined and dined in Milan and on two occasions met the middle man although I did nothing. Fantastic!” he said on his facebook wall, mocking media reports. Apparently, reacting to the summons served by the investigative agencies, he said, “Suddenly CBI and ED have discovered what a bad boy I was.</p>

<p>Agencies, Mumbai</p>
<p>Bombay HC orders demolition of Adarsh buildingMumbai, Apr 29 (UNI) In a landmark order, the Bombay High Court today ordered the Union Environment Ministry to demolish 31-storey Adarsh Cooperative Housing Society here. The HC stayed its own order to enable the housing society to appeal against it in the Apex Court.</p>
<p>A division bench of Justices RV More and RG Ketkar, while passing order for demolition, stayed the operation of its judgement for 12 weeks after the advocates for the society contended that they will prefer an appeal against the court order .</p>
<p>The state and environment authorities objected to the stay. It also directed the state to initiate criminal prosecution against officers involved in the scam and to restore the plot. The order to raze the building comes after the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests (MoEF) passed an order to demolish the scam-hit society in 2011, following which its members approached the Bombay High Court challenging it.</p>
<p>The ministry had on January 16, 2011 directed the Society to demolish within three months the “unauthorised” building for violating coastal regulations. The high court also directed the defence ministry to conduct a departmental inquiry against its officers for not taking action earlier.</p>
<p>The court also directed the Ministry of Defence to conduct a departmental inquiry into its officers for not taking action early enough when the building scam came to light. Originally meant to be a six-storey structure to house Kargil war heroes and war widows, the society was converted into a 100-metre-tall building with politicians, bureaucrats and army officers allegedly conspiring to get flats allotted to them in the cooperative society at below-market rates.</p>
<p>The scam was unearthed in November 2010 which forced the then Maharashtra chief minister Ashok Chavan to resign. The court was deciding on numerous petitions filed by the Adarsh Housing Society, the ministry of defence and public interest litigant Santosh Daundkar about the construction of the 31-story high rise at posh Cuffe Parade next to defence establishments.</p>

<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>The Rajya Sabha today witnessed an uproar by the Janata Dal (United) and the Congress over their demand for the arrest of culprits and probe into the incident of lynching and hanging of two cattle traders in Jharkhand two months ago. Raising the issue during the Zero hour, Ghulam Rasool Balyawi of the JD(U) said, ‘’two months ago two cattle traders were killed in Jhabar village under Balumath police station area of Latehar district.</p>
<p>The Muslim cattle traders were found hanging from a tree.’’ Mr Balyawi said the police had failed to take any action in the matter. What was worse, he said, people in the area who demanded action in the matter, were asked to go to Pakistan. The uproar started after Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi, responding to the concern expressed by the Member, said the Government would first have to inquire whether what the Member was saying is true.</p>
<p>Immediately, the concerned members and his colleagues from the JD(U) were on their feet, protesting against the statement of the Minister. Amid the uproar, Leader of the Opposition Ghulam Nabi Azad said in course of his own research he had found that it is a serious incident and demanded the setting up of a Parliamentary Committee to probe the incident.</p>
<p>‘’Two months have happened since the incident occurred. I am surprised that the Minister of State for Parliamentary Affairs is doubting the veracity of the incident. It is a matter of shame.’’ Deputy Chairman P J Kurien said, ‘’if a Member is making a statement in Zero Hour we should accept it as a fact.’’ Coming to Mr Naqvi’s defence, Minority Affairs Minister Najma Heptulla said,’’when a Member refers to an incident in the House, we have to authenticate it.</p>

<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>Amidst sharp protests of trade unions, the Centre today settled the interest on Employee Provident Fund to 8 point 8 per cent, 0 point 1 per cent higher than what it declared a couple of days back.</p>
<p>Addressing reporters here, Union Labour Minister Bandaru Dattatreya said given the prevailing economic circumstances, 8.8 per cent rate of interest will serve everybody’s interest. &#8220;We have decided that the rate of interest on EPF will be 8.8 per cent. I thank Finance Minister Arun Jaitley for this.</p>

<p>Agencies, Mumbai</p>
<p>City police have registered a case against Bhumata Brigade chief Trupti Desai and members of human rights wing group for creating ruckus at public place near Haji Ali Dargah here late last night. Police had detained eight people and they were later allowed to go home late last night, police said here today.</p>
<p>All were detained under the Bombay Police act. Ms Desai and members of human rights wing have staged peaceful protest, earlier, last evening near dargah without prior permission from the police. They staged a march to Chief Minister Devendra Fandavis official residence ‘Varsha’, and were stopped by the police on the way itself.</p>
<p>They were detained and brought to Azad Maidan police station. Desai had recently successfully led campaigns to break bar on women at the sanctum sanctorum of Shani Shingnapur and Trimbakeshwar temples at Nashik in Maharashtra.</p>

<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>The Aam Aadmi Party today threatened to ‘gherao’ Prime Minister Narendra Modi if he fails to take any action against Congress president Sonia Gandhi in the VVIP helicopter bribery case within a week.</p>
<p>Addressing a press conference here, AAP leader Ashutosh said there was a match fixing going on between the BJP and the Congress as a result of which, all government agencies like CBI and ED were sleeping.</p>
<p>He asked the Prime Minister as to why no action has been taken against the Congress president and others even when a court in Italy had already given a decision in the AgustaWestland case.<br />
He also said his party has written a letter to the Prime Minister requesting strong action against those involved.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal had dared the government to put Congress president Sonia Gandhi and others behind bars who have been named in an Italian court order.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Agencies, Dehradun</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">The Uttarakhand High Court posted to May 9, the matter of the nine rebel Congress MLAs, who have challenged Assembly Speaker Govind Singh Kunjwal&#8217;s order disqualifying them. The hearing had to be postponed as their senior counsel C A Sundaram failed to appear before the court.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"> This was the second time that the matter was being deferred for the same reason. According to sources, as the proceedings began, the dissidents&#8217; counsel informed the court that Mr Sundaram could not be present, following which the single bench of Justice U C Dhyani asked Amit Sibal, counsel for the Congress chief whip, to put forward his arguments.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"> Mr Sibal contended that those who extend support to the ruling party do not oppose the Appropriation bill and that the Speaker&#8217;s decision was to strengthen democracy. The rebels, despite being from the ruling party accompanied the 26 BJP MLAs to the Raj Bhawan to submit a memorandum to the Governor and claimed that the government was in minority thus violating the anti-defection law.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"> They demanded the dismissal of the government on April 18 morning and voted against the Appropriation bill of 44,000 crore rupees which included several developmental plans, he argued. Later, Mr Sundaram&#8217;s colleagues pleaded that since the senior counsel could not be present, the hearing be posted. The court, then deferred the hearing date to May 9.</p>

<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Agencies, New Delhi</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Terming ‘irresponsible’ the allegation made by the BJP against its party president Sonia Gandhi in the AgustaWestland deal, the Congress, charging the ruling party of ‘misleading’ people in the matter, said it was raking up the issue to divert attention from its ‘inaction ‘ in the matter. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Talking to reports here, AICC spokesperson Abhishek Manu Singhvi, hitting out at BJP president Amit Shah’s statement against Ms Sonia Gandhi in the matter, said,’’Shah as president of the BJP is expected to be relatively, I use the word relatively, more responsible. Actually, as the president of a party, he is being most irresponsible. Why should Mrs. Sonia Gandhi explain, what should she explain. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">‘’ Mr Singhvi said the allegations by the BJP leaders, including Mr Shah only reflected their own inaction in the matter during the last 24 months. ‘’Is the President of the BJP giving a ‘Vote of No Confidence’ in his own Ruling Party’s Government by admitting that 24 months of hostile NDA-BJP-Modi Rule could not tell you what you wanted to know. 24 months – is it such a ‘Nikammi Sarkar’, that they could not tell him either the CBI or the ED or 20 other Departments, even partially what you wanted to know. </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">If he is saying it on the basis of these four references which have been in circulation for the last three days, you look at the irony, criminal cases instituted by the UPA Government, 24 months under the NDA Government and nothing is done and you start tilting at windmills because an Italian Court makes four references,’’Mr Singhvi said. On Ms Sonia Gandhi’s name allegedly figuring in the deal, he said,’’are we living in a Banana Republic that everybody in this room should be liable to answer a criminal charge?</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span"> Today if there is an allegation, that bribes have taken place prima-facie. Therefore, the senior most person in the room must be guilty. Where is that connectivity? Because there is some bribe in the Media, must you assume that the Chairmen of two top Media Houses are involved? Is this the way, the way like a Banana Republic is run?’’ On a question about Ahmed Patel, political secretary to the Congress President, Mr Singhvi said &#8220;there could be 20 APs in Somalia, Italy and France.’’ </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">Alleging that the BJP was raking up the issue to hide its inaction in the matter, he said,’’ The point is you want to keep the pot boiling, the least you could have done in 24 months, you should come up with credible, which is known as legal material &#8211; not innuendoes, not insinuations and not merely a person who is known to be ‘Congressman hater’ and a ‘Gandhibaitor’ given a post of Rajya Sabha to create ‘hulla gulla’.’’ </span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span">On Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar’s statement about blacklisting of of AgustaWestland, Mr Singhvi said,’’half truth is worse than untruth’. If Mr. Parrikar had said it inside the Parliament, he would have faced ‘Privilege Motion’. Luckily for him he said it outside and defamation laws of this country are loose and slow.</span></p>

<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>Joining the ongoing political debate over the VVIP Chopper deal, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal today questioned the silence of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in the matter and charged him with protecting top Congress leadership named in the scam.</p>
<p>Taking to twitter, the Delhi Chief Minister said,&#8221;why is the PM silent on Agusta? First, the BJP spared Vadra (son-in-law of Ms Gandhi), now protecting entire Congress top brass in Agusta?”</p>
<p>“Shudn&#8217;t those named in Italy court order be immediately arrested n interrogated? Mujhpe CBI ki raid karai. Par Congressio par raid nahi kara rahe? (CBI raids were carried out me. Why sparing Congress men now?),” the Chief Minister added.</p>
<p>There is a raging political debate on the issue after an Italian court named Congress President Sonia Gandhi, and other Congress leaders in connection with the alleged pay offs in Rs 36,000 crore AgustaWestland VIP chopper deal.</p>
<p>However, after two days of BJP onslaught over the VVIP chopper deal, the Congress yesterday chose to fight back with Ms Gandhi daring the government to complete the probe to bring out the truth and terming all charges against her &#8221;completely baseless&#8221;.</p>

<p>Members cutting across party line in the Lok Sabha today made a forceful plea for bringing back iconic diamond Kohinoor from the UK and offering it to Lord Jagannath temple in Puri supporting the views that diamond was not gifted to the British but was obtained from Maharaja Ranjeet Singh&#8217;s successor under duress.</p>
<p>The issue was raised during the Zero Hour by BJD Member Bhartruhari Mahtab citing letter written by the then political agent of Lord Dalhousie in the court of the Maharaja. The letter written in 1949 says that when Maharaja Ranjit Singh was breathing his last, he had expressed his last wish which was to donate Kohinoor to Lord Jagannath.</p>
<p>After his death his successor, Maharaja Duleep Singh, who was a minor then, was made to gift the diamond to the Queen Victoria.<br />
Mr Mahtab said the gift was not of cheerful volition as has been claimed but was made under duress, so it was the duty of the Government to restore Kohinoor where it should belong to&#8211;Lord Jagannath. He said according to purans, Kohinoor was no other diamond than the Puranic Syamantaka Mani possessed by Lord Krishna, and this diamond can be possessed either by god or women without any harmful impact.</p>
<p>He gave the example of the return of the Sword of Tipu Sultan to the country after it was bought by fugitive liquor baron Vijay Mallya in an auction.</p>
<p>Mr Mahtab said he did not mean that the Government should avail of the services of the liquor baron to get Kohinoor back but it should make all efforts to obtain it.</p>
<p>Mr Chandu Majra of the Akali Dal said the stand taken by the Culture Ministry in the Supreme Court was shameful. Ms Meenakshi Lekhi of the BJP sought to put the record straight regarding the Government&#8217;s stand on the Kohinoor in the apex court, saying the media had wrongly reported that the Culture Ministry held that the diamond was a gift to Queen Victoria.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Agencies, New Delhi</p>
<p>President Pranab Mukherjee today congratulated the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) on the successful launch of PSLV-C33 carrying IRNSS-1G, India’s seventh and final in the series of navigation satellites of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).</p>
<p>In a message to Mr A S Kiran Kumar, Chairman of ISRO, the President said, “I extend my hearty congratulations to you and your entire team at the ISRO on the successful launch of PSLV-C33 carrying IRNSS-1G, the seventh and final in the series of navigation satellites of the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System (IRNSS).</p>
<p>The launch of PSLV-C33 is an important landmark in our space programme with India now joining the small group of nations having their own regional satellite navigation system. It demonstrates, yet again, India’s growing capabilities in space launch technology. The nation is proud of this achievement.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8221;Kindly convey my greetings to all members of your team and all others involved in this great mission. I wish the ISRO continued success in its future endeavours,&#8221; the President said.</p>

<p>Agencies, Sriharikota</p>
<p>The Indian Space agency’s vision of having is own regional navigation satellite system, on par with the GPS system of US, became a reality when PSLV-C33 successfully launched the seventh and last navigation satellite IRNSS-1G from the SHAR Range here today.</p>
<p>After a 51.5 hour countdown, the 44.4 m tall, four-stage vehicle took off majestically from the First Launch Pad at 1250 hrs and after a flight duration of about 20 minutes, injected the 1,425 kg satellite into the desired orbit.</p>
<p>There were jubilant scenes at the Mission Control Centre as scientists were seen celebrating the occasion by hugging each other. ISRO Chairman A S Kiran Kumar termed the launch as successful and said the PSLV has once again proved its versatility. Prime Minister Narendra Modi greeted the ISRO scientists for the success of the launch.</p>
<p>In its 35th flight, the PSLV-C33, with 34 successive successful missions, the workhorse launch vehicle injected the satellite into the sub Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub GTO), with a perigee of 284 km (nearest point to earth) and an apogee of 20,657 km (farthest point to earth) with an inclination of 17.86 deg with respect to the equatorial plane. IRNSS-1G, with a life span of 12 years, was the last navigation satellite in the constellation of seven satellites constituting the IRNSS space segment.</p>
